# camplight-assignment

Please find the code to the assignment in this repository.

For the tech stack, I used expressjs and prisma for the backend, with Postgres as the database, and react/redux for the frontend

# How to run the code

- run the docker-compose file that contains a container setup for postgres that works with the backend
- run the node backend and frontend projects with `npm start`
- navigate to `http://localhost:9000`

## Progress at 4 hours

- Basic working app, with pagination, user addition and deletion
- user listing updates without refreshing page
- user-friendly messages on errors

## What can be improved

- handling UI loading states and empty states
- writing unit tests for the backend
- a docker-compose file that could run the whole stack
- hard-coding of values at certain places, like page-size
- production setup, as of now everything works in development mode

## Thank you

Thank you for the opportunity to take an assingment, I look forward to your feedback on the same.
